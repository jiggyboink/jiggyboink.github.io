        <p> Growtopia started with growing trees at its core, <br>
            but over its 11-year history, it has blossomed into so much <br>
            more. Become a surgeon and save lives, hone your skills     <br>
            as a top chef and create delicious meals, cast your fishing <br> 
            rod and land legendary catches, build ships and embark on <br>
            star voyages, and craft Parkour worlds filled with mazes,  <br> 
             traps, and puzzles. With endless possibilities and a thriving <br> 
             community, it's like having hundreds of games in one.
